DAY 1
Today the project was to create a band name by taking inputs from user for their pet's name and city in which they grew up in.
This project used input statement of python special character '\n' and string concatentation.
As I already know python basics and syntax this was good practice to reinforce my basics and logic building.
To tackle this problem I started with plan of action of what will be needed and how to go about it.Also thought of another way of tackling this problem using function.
In this way I want to create a habit of plan of action before tackling a problem and writing a log of how did i go about it so whenever I refer I can look for mistakes and come up with better efficient solutions.
